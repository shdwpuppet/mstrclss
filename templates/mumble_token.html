<h3>THIS CLASS' AUTH TOKEN IS: {{ class.mumble_token }}</h3>
<p>The instructor of this class has indicated that it will include a mumble portion. In order to keep classes separate and to reduce the incidence of class disruptions, we have implemented a mumble auth token system. You will need to manually put in the mumble auth token to be able to access you class, but don't worry, it is really easy. Please watch this short video by Kevinispwn to learn more.</p>
